									ERPToolkit release 1.x

WHAT IS ERPTOOLKIT ?

  ERPToolkit is a collection of classes and winforms that are extremely useful when working
  with any kind of ERP software that runs under the windows platform.

  It has all the features you would expect in a tool for working with ERP under Windows like
  tools for working with DATABASES(SQL SERVER), SERVERS(SQL SERVER), ODBC, UDLFILE, I/O, 
  REFACTORING SCRIPT(VBSCRIPT), PROCESSING MSI PACKAGES, WINDOWS FONTS, UAC(USER ACCOUNT CONTROL), 
  WINDOWS SHORTCUTS, ENVIRONMENT and many other useful methods like GENERAL METHODS.

  The ERPToolkit was originally developed to work with Dataplace Symphony ERP, but, as said above
  you can work with any ERP that runs under Windows platform. If you work with ERP and have noticed that
  there is something missing, be free to implement classes and methods for the needs you have but remember,
  if you implement features, these cannot only be used just for your ERP.
  
ERPTOOLKIT ONLY WORKS WITH .NET ?

  No. One of the main purposes of the toolkit is to work with vbscript using COM INTEROP, thus, 
  all classes - even those which makes the ERPToolkit control - are available for 
  scripts. That's why all the examples of how to work with the toolkit were done
  with vbscript.

WHAT LANGUAGE DO THE WINFORMS WORK ?

  Nowadays, the ERPToolkit's winforms work with:
  -ENGLISH 
  -PORTUGUESE
  -SPANISH

  The ERPToolkit work with resources of languages, thus, to add a new language is
  quite simple. So, if you would like to start helping somehow, this could be a good
  place to start.

BUILDING THE ERPTOOLKIT SOURCE:

- Launch your "Visual Studio" version >= 2012.
- The toolkit does not contain any external reference, thus, you can just build clicking in BUILD > Build Solution(F6).
- Execute the register.bat. It will register and generate the .reg file with all the ERPToolkit references that'll be added
  into the registry for you.

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:

- If you have problems that seem to be a bug, please, report me via e-mail that I will be happy
  to review and fix(if it is the case). If you want to try to solve the problem by yourself be free
  to ask me questions via e-mail. Maybe I can take a while to reply but I'll answer to you.
